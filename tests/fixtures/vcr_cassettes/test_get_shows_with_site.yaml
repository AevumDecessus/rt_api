        time, on Twits &amp; Crits, our noble band of adventurers made their way to
        the western holdfast to rendezvous with Captain Aegis Sniller and collect
        the reward bounty placed upon the hideous heads of the fugitive Moondog Brothers.
        Sniller offered the group additional payment to stay and fight the approaching
        orc army.<\/p>\n\n<p>Two hundred and fifty gold pieces proved a convincing
        sum, and the group agreed to extend the contract, as willing mercenaries.
        All relished in their newfound wealth, except for Miri, who received a considerably
        lesser sum of one hundred and fifty gold pieces, much to his chagrin. For
        the young halfling Grimo, the companionship of brave war horse Chauncey was
        payment enough.<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>As the army advanced and the
        sun set upon our heroes, the very cool Decker procured his metallic wizardry
        tablet and soothed the tired warriors with a \u201csweet midi tune.\u201d<\/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Now

        time, on Twits &amp; Crits, our noble band of adventurers made their way to
        the western holdfast to rendezvous with Captain Aegis Sniller and collect
        the reward bounty placed upon the hideous heads of the fugitive Moondog Brothers.
        Sniller offered the group additional payment to stay and fight the approaching
        orc army.\n\nTwo hundred and fifty gold pieces proved a convincing sum, and
        the group agreed to extend the contract, as willing mercenaries. All relished
        in their newfound wealth, except for Miri, who received a considerably lesser
        sum of one hundred and fifty gold pieces, much to his chagrin. For the young
        halfling Grimo, the companionship of brave war horse Chauncey was payment
        enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the army advanced and the sun set upon our
        heroes, the very cool Decker procured his metallic wizardry tablet and soothed
        the tired warriors with a \u201csweet midi tune.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow
        the army approaches and our heroes prepare for one of the most dangerous encounters
        of their lives...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow us

        4, <\/p>\n\n<p>I am still currently hiding behind the curtains, the time is
        finally drawing near. <\/p>\n\n<p>Days previous, Elyse came to me in the middle
        of an edit with a fantastic idea. All it would take, a few minutes of my time
        and lying in wait in the old office to scare the guys while they played a
        new scary game.<\/p>\n\n<p>I can only allude to the game play recording having
        been pushed back since no one has been in the office since the extended lunch
        break return for Dude Soup''s recording. I can hear Elyse''s voice on this
        episode, and I want to call out to ask if I should keep this charade going,
        but I also cherish my hiding spot and would hate to give it up so easily.
        I try texting her phone; \"Who''s this and is that a California phone number?\"
        Apparently the number Elyse gave me connected me with a young adult man from

        4, \n\nI am still currently hiding behind the curtains, the time is finally
        drawing near. \n\nDays previous, Elyse came to me in the middle of an edit
        with a fantastic idea. All it would take, a few minutes of my time and lying
        in wait in the old office to scare the guys while they played a new scary
        game.\n\nI can only allude to the game play recording having been pushed back
        since no one has been in the office since the extended lunch break return
        for Dude Soup''s recording. I can hear Elyse''s voice on this episode, and
        I want to call out to ask if I should keep this charade going, but I also
        cherish my hiding spot and would hate to give it up so easily. I try texting
        her phone; \"Who''s this and is that a California phone number?\" Apparently
        the number Elyse gave me connected me with a young adult man from the Connecticut

        barren world is watching that little subscriber counter tick up, up, up. \n\nMy
        mother said I would never amount to anything. I really screwed up my 5th grade
        performance of Wind in the Willows. Sorry, Badger - once again, I apologize
        for ripping your tail off during the afternoon show. For once, I though would
        like to prove MOTHER DEAREST wrong. I''d like to show her that Internet Videos
        are a real thing. That my job means something.\n\nI really need that number
        to go up. So please - for the sake of my family - subscribe to Funhaus. Maybe
        watch a video. Buy a t-shirt. It is Merch March after all. And if I could
        ask one more favor, just email my mom. Tell her I made it. That I''m worth
        something. That the dumpster behind the Circle K where she left me in 1992
        will someday have a plaque saying \"THIS IS WHERE IT ALL STARTED!!!\"\n\nPresident
